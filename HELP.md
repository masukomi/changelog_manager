# HELP

## Having problems with your install? 

### Can you system find it? 
Have you moved it to a directory in your PATH?

`cd` to one of your project directories and run `which changelog_manager`

Did it show up? If so, it's in your PATH. If not, run 

`cp path/to/changelog_manager /usr/local/bin`

### Does it blow up?

Try running the `run_me_first.sh` script in the `bin` directory.

## Having trouble using it?
Be sure to read the `README.md`. Note that there are additional docs in the
`docs` directory that are linked from the README.md

## NONE OF THAT HELPED!
